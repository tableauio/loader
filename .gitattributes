# Treat all files in this repo as binary, with no git magic updating
# line endings. This produces predictable results in different environments.
#
# Windows users contributing to this repo will need to use a modern version
# of git and editors capable of LF line endings.
#
# Windows .bat files are known to have multiple bugs when run with LF
# endings, and so they are checked in with CRLF endings, with a test
# to catch problems. (See https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37791.)
#
# We'll prevent accidental CRLF line endings from entering the repo
# via MR checks and tests.
